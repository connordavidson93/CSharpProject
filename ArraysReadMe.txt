Arrays:

An array is a way of storing a collection of data of the same type together. Rather than storing similar data individually, such as "string 1", "string 2", "string 3"...etc., you can store them in an array. They are useful in shortening code and avoiding unncessary repetition in C#, just as in JavaScript and other languages.

It begins by declaring it in a similar way as an individual variable. After stating the type of variable, it is followed by open and closed square brackets "[ ]". This distinction shows that an array is not a type of variable, but a collection of individual variables of the same type. After naming the array, there must be a statement of how many variables are within. This is made by defining the array as "new" with the type and the number of elements within square brackets. Then the array can be initialized. However, it can also be done in the same line, just as a function or loop, by using curly brackets after the named array and stating each element within separated by a comma. With this method, you don't state the length of the array. It is implied by the number of elements given.

You can access each of the individual elements of the array anytime in the code by calling the array by name and putting an integer within square brackets. The number refers to sequence of elements in the array starting with "0" and then counting upwards to the total number of elements.

Arrays are useful for functions, loops, and other basic commands. They have a property for their length, as well as for their elements, so that the elements can be run together or individually as the coding needs.
