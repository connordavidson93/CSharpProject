If Statements

An often requirement of coding is making a decision based on a condition. This is met by an "If" statement, which is similar in C# as it is with JavaScript. The statement is that "if a certain conditions is met, x happens." The "if" could be anything from a value being greater than or less than a specification, a function being called or run, or any number of other commands in coding. It allows for you to make decisions in coding for what the code should do if there are a variable of outcomes intended.

An extension of the If Statement is the "If/Else" Statement. In this, if the first condition is not met by the "if" then you set up something to run for "else". "If x is true, do y. Else do z."

This can even be expanded further in a sequence by adding "Else If". This adds another condition to be met and adds for more functionality in the command. "If x is true, do y. Else if x is false, do z."
