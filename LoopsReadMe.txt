Loops

Loops in programming are a way to repeat lines of code. Looping and repeating is referred to as "iterating". Loops are written as functions with a name and set of arguments. Everything within the body (inside the { } ) is what is actually run in the loop.

Important and common loops include "While", "Do-While", "For", and "For Each".

While Loops run as long as a condition is met. For instance, if a while loop's conditional is (variable < 4), the loop will continue running for as long as the variable remains less than four. 

The "do-while" loop is almost identical to the while loop, but with one important difference: While loops test the conditional at the beginning of the body, do-while loops test the conditional at the end of the body, and the syntax "Do" is before the loop, and the "While" with the conditionals is after the body. Thus, the body of a do-while loop always runs at least once.

For Loops run similarly to while loops, but us a different syntax. There are three specific conditionals inside the parentheses of arguments in a for loop. The first it optional, allowing to initialize any variables used in the loop. The second must be supplied in any for loop, providing a conditional that will be looked at every time before the iteration of the loop. The final conditional allows for any increment or decrement of variables used in the loop.

For-Each Loops are very useful for running through collections, like arrays. Unlike most loops that keep going if conditions are not specifically made, For-Each will run through each item in its collection one by one and then it stops at the end of the collection. You cannot alter the items in a collection using a for-each loop. If you want to modify an element, you must use a for loop.
